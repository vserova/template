======================================================

Part 4 discusses NCBI wrappers for 3rd-party packages. The wrappers incorporate (and may extend) selected open source packages, and provide a simplified way for developers to use those packages in conjunction with the C++ Toolkit. Typical NCBI extensions include the ability to execute the 3rd-party code in a standard environment and adapting demo or test code to work within the Toolkit framework. The following is a list of chapters in this part:

-   [XmlWrapp (XML parsing and handling, XSLT, XPath)](ch_xmlwrapp.html)
-   [JsonWrapp (JSON parsing and handling)](ch_jsonwrapp.html)
