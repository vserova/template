### Creating your repository

To start your project on GitHub you have to create a repository. All NCBI repositories must be reside under GitHub NCBI organisation [https://github.com/ncbi](https://github.com/ncbi). To create a repository, you need to submit a request to [github-tools@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](mailto:github-tools@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) You will have to provide them with the name for your repository. This name will be part of URL for your GitHub website if you will use GitHub pages and our template. You can find the information about GitHub Pages [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

You also have to ask NCBI GitHub support group to give admin permissions to a person or group of persons that will administrate your repository.
