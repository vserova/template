| **Special thanks to Jim Ostell**           | **Established the biological and bibliographic data model supported by the C++ Toolkit. He also established the overall design, priorities, and goals for C++ Toolkit based on experience building and using the NCBI C Toolkit which preceeded it. He continues to cheer on the list of talented software developers and scientists below who are primarily responsible for making the C++ Toolkit a reality and for introducing most of its nicer features.**                |

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Q. Our product makes use of the NCBI source code, and we did changes
    and additions to that version of the NCBI code to better fit it to
    our needs. Can we copyright the code, and how?

    A. You can copyright only the *changes* or the *additions* you made to the
    NCBI source code. You should identify unambiguously those sections of
    the code that were modified, e.g. by commenting any changes you made
    in the code you distribute. Therefore, your license has to make clear
    to users that your product is a combination of code that is public domain
    within the U.S. (but may be subject to copyright by the U.S. in foreign
    countries) and code that has been created or modified by you.


    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Q. Can we (re)license all or part of the NCBI source code?

    A. No, you cannot license or relicense the source code written by NCBI
    since you cannot claim any copyright in the software that was developed
    at NCBI as a 'government work' and consequently is in the public domain
    within the U.S.


    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Q. What if these copyright guidelines are not clear enough or are not
    applicable to my particular case?

    A. Contact us. Send your questions to 'toolbox@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov'.
