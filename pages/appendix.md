Books and links to C++ and STL manuals
--------------------------------------

Books

-   *On To C++, by Patrick Henry Winston*. If you are looking for a short and concise tutorial, this is as close as you can get. It doesn't cover all of C++, but many of the essential features (except the STL). A decent first book to buy.

-   *The C++ Primer, Third Edition*, by Stanley Lippman and Josee Lajoie. A decent book, much expanded from previous editions. Gets carried away with very long examples, which makes it harder to use as a reference. Full coverage of ANSI/ISO C++.

-   *The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition* by Bjarne Stroustrup. Often called the best book for C++ written in Danish. Written by the designer of C++, this is a difficult read unless you already know C++. Full coverage of ANSI/ISO C++.

-   *Effective C++, Second Edition: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*, by Scott Meyers. . A must-have that describes lots of tips, tricks, and pitfalls of C++ programming.

-   *More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*, by Scott Meyers.. Same as above. For example, how is the new operator different from operator new? Operator new is called by the new operator to allocate memory for the object being created. This is how you hook your own malloc into C++.
